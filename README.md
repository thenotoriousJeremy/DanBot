# DanBot

DanBot is a modular Discord bot designed to provide a variety of features, including a yearly recap of server activity, managing birthdays, workout tracking, music playback, relationship mapping, and a text-to-speech system. It supports custom commands and features to enhance community interaction.

## Features

### **Server Wrapped**
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Creates a word cloud from messages sent in the server.
- **Activity Heatmap**: Visualizes server activity by hour.
- **Message Count Analysis**: Graphs message counts by user.
- **Word Count Analysis**: Graphs word counts by user.
- **Most Reacted Messages**: Highlights the top messages based on reactions.
- **Longest Messages**: Highlights the longest messages sent in the server.

### **Birthday Tracker**

- **Leaderboard**: Displays the leaderboard of users based on workouts logged.
- **Weekly Reset with Demeaning Messages**: At the weekly reset, the bot sends demeaning messages to users who didn‚Äôt meet their goal. If a user misses their goal for too many consecutive weeks, they must react with üëç within one week to remain in the tracker. (Workouts are kept even if tracking stops.)

### **Fish Speech**
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Generates TTS audio from input text using the Fish Speech API.
- **Voice Channel Integration**: Plays the generated audio in a Discord voice channel.

### **Music**
- **YouTube Music Playback**: Play music directly from YouTube using modern, reliable methods.
- **Queue System**: If a song is already playing, new tracks are added to the queue.
- **Slash Commands**: Use slash commands such as `/join`, `/play`, `/skip`, `/queue`, `/stop`, and `/leave` for controlling music playback.
- **yt-dlp & FFmpeg Integration**: Uses the yt-dlp library to extract audio and FFmpeg (with a locally specified `ffmpeg.exe`) for audio streaming.
- **Search Support**: If a plain text query is provided instead of a URL, the bot automatically searches YouTube and plays the first result.

### **Relationship Tree**
- **User-Editable Network Mapping**: Create and edit connections between users to build a visual network (or "tree") of relationships.
- **Add/Remove Connections**: Use slash commands such as `/addconnection` and `/removeconnection` to manage user connections.
- **Graphical Display**: Generate a visual representation of the network using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
- **Customizable Labels and Colors**: Display user avatars and names on the graph with different edge colors representing different types of connections (for example, sibling, friend, roommate, partner, acquaintance, cousin).
